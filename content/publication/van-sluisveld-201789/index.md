abstract: The European Union (EU) is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG)
  emission levels by 80%–95% in 2050 compared to 1990 levels. Various approaches have
  been developed to secure and evaluate the progress made towards this objective.
  To gain insights into how EU Member States are aligning to this collective long-term
  objective, we systematically compare the planning and ex-ante evaluation processes
  for five EU countries (respectively Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and
  the United Kingdom). The comparative analysis consists of a qualitative comparison
  of (1) the governance of long-term policy planning and evaluation processes, (2)
  the national arrangement for quantitative (model-based) ex-ante policy evaluation
  and (3) the national arrangement for qualitative ex-ante policy evaluation (stakeholder
  participation). In a second step we conduct a quantitative comparison of national
  model-based ex-ante evaluation studies to assess the relative differences between
  the considered routes and the differences across the various countries. Although
  the five Member States plan policies along the same EU objective, we find a high
  diversity in how long-term commitments are established, governed and evaluated on
  the national level. Model-based scenario analyses are commonly used to explore and
  evaluate the possible national routes towards the EU 2050 objective. However, as
  these processes mostly concentrate on domestic action, they pay little attention
  to how domestic policies are affected by, or affecting, other international activities
  throughout Europe. Hence, current findings suggest that cross-border collaboration
  and stakeholder participation could further strengthen the analytical understanding
  of required transformative change in Europe and subsequently lead to a more durable
  long-term solution over time. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd
