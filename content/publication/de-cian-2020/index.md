abstract: Increasing realism in quantitative system modelling with respect to the
  representation of actors, decision-making, and institutions is critical to better
  understand the transition towards a low-carbon sustainable society. Yet, studies
  using quantitative system models, which have become a key analytical tool to support
  sustainability and decarbonization policies, focus on outcomes, therefore overlooking
  the dynamics of the drivers of change. We explore opportunities that arise from
  a deeper engagement of quantitative systems modelling with social science. We argue
  that several opportunities for enriching the realism in model-based scenario analysis
  can arise through model refinements oriented towards a more detailed approach in
  terms of actor heterogeneity, as well as through integration across different analytical
  and disciplinary approaches. Several opportunities that do not require major changes
  in model structure are ready to be seized. Promising ones include combining different
  types of models and enriching model-based scenarios with evidence from applied economics
  and transition studies. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
