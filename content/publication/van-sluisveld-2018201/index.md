abstract: Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are computer-based instruments used
  to assess the implications of human activity on the human and earth system. They
  are simultaneously also used to explore possible response strategies to climate
  change. As IAMs operate simplified representations of real-world processes within
  their model structures, they have been frequently criticised to insufficiently represent
  the opportunities and challenges in future energy systems over time. To test whether
  projections by IAMs diverge in systematic ways from projections made by technology
  experts we elicited expert opinion on prospective change for two indicators and
  compared these with the outcomes of IAM studies. We specifically focused on five
  (energy) technology families (solar, wind, biomass, nuclear, and carbon capture
  and storage or CCS) and compared the considered implications of the presence or
  absence of climate policy on the growth and diffusion of these technologies over
  the short (2030) to medium (2050) term. IAMs and experts were found to be in relatively
  high agreement on system change in a business-as-usual scenario, albeit with significant
  differences in the estimated magnitude of technology deployment over time. Under
  stringent climate policy assumptions, such as the internationally agreed upon objective
  to limit global mean temperature increase to no more than 2 °C, we found that the
  differences in estimated magnitudes became smaller for some technologies and larger
  for others. Compared to experts, IAM simulations projected a greater reliance on
  nuclear power and CCS to meet a 2 °C climate target. In contrast, experts projected
  a stronger growth in renewable energy technologies, particularly solar power. We
  close by discussing several factors that are considered influential to the alignment
  of the IAM and expert perspectives in this study. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd
