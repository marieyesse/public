abstract: Packaging materials are one of the largest contributors to municipal solid
  waste generation. In this paper, we evaluate the material impacts of packaging policy
  in The Netherlands, focusing on the role of material efficiency (or waste prevention).
  Since 1991, five different policies have been implemented to reduce the environmental
  impact of packaging. The analysis shows that Dutch packaging policies helped to
  reduce the total packaging volume until 1999. After 2000, packaging consumption
  increased more rapidly than the baseline, suggesting that policy measures were not
  effective. Generally, we see limited attention to material efficiency to reduce
  packaging material use. For this purpose, we tried to gain more insight in recent
  activities on material efficiency, by building a database of packaging prevention
  initiatives. We identified 131 alterations to packaging implemented in the period
  2005-2010, of which weight reduction was the predominant approach. More appropriate
  packaging policy is needed to increase the effectiveness of policies, with special
  attention to material efficiency. Â© 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.
