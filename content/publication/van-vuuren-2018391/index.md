abstract: Mitigation scenarios that achieve the ambitious targets included in the
  Paris Agreement typically rely on greenhouse gas emission reductions combined with
  net carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere, mostly accomplished through
  large-scale application of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, and afforestation.
  However, CDR strategies face several difficulties such as reliance on underground
  CO2 storage and competition for land with food production and biodiversity protection.
  The question arises whether alternative deep mitigation pathways exist. Here, using
  an integrated assessment model, we explore the impact of alternative pathways that
  include lifestyle change, additional reduction of non-CO2 greenhouse gases and more
  rapid electrification of energy demand based on renewable energy. Although these
  alternatives also face specific difficulties, they are found to significantly reduce
  the need for CDR, but not fully eliminate it. The alternatives offer a means to
  diversify transition pathways to meet the Paris Agreement targets, while simultaneously
  benefiting other sustainability goals. © 2018 The Author(s).
