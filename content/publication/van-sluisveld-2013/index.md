abstract: 'This paper looks into the regional mitigation strategies of five major
  economies (China, EU, India, Japan, and USA) in the context of the 2°C target, using
  a multi-model comparison. In order to stay in line with the 2°C target, a tripling
  or quadrupling of mitigation ambitions is required in all regions by 2050, employing
  vigorous decarbonization of the energy supply system and achieving negative emissions
  during the second half of the century. In all regions looked at, decarbonization
  of energy supply (and in particular power generation) is more important than reducing
  energy demand. Some differences in abatement strategies across the regions are projected:
  In India and the USA the emphasis is on prolonging fossil fuel use by coupling conventional
  technologies with carbon storage, whereas the other main strategy depicts a shift
  to carbon-neutral technologies with mostly renewables (China, EU) or nuclear power
  (Japan). Regions with access to large amounts of biomass, such as the USA, China,
  and the EU, can make a trade-off between energy related emissions and land related
  emissions, as the use of bioenergy can lead to a net increase in land use emissions.
  After supply-side changes, the most important abatement strategy focuses on end-use
  efficiency improvements, leading to considerable emission reductions in both the
  industry and transport sectors across all regions. Abatement strategies for non-CO2
  emissions and land use emissions are found to have a smaller potential. Inherent
  model, as well as collective, biases have been observed affecting the regional response
  strategy or the available reduction potential in specific (end-use) sectors. © 2013
