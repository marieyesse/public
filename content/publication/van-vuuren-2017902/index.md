abstract: Although nearly all 2 °C scenarios use negative CO2 emission technologies,
  only relatively small investments are being made in them, and concerns are being
  raised regarding their large-scale use. If no explicit policy decisions are taken
  soon, however, their use will simply be forced on us to meet the Paris climate targets.
