abstract: In this paper, we apply two global Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) and
  one detailed European electricity system model to explore the consequences of different
  narrative-based low-carbon scenarios on the electricity system from the global to
  national scale. The narratives are based on insights from socio-technical transition
  analysis on niche-innovations. The main aim of this exercise is to examine the solution
  space in low-carbon scenarios for electricity supply from the global to national
  scale, which is largely neglected when focusing on cost-optimal solutions only.
  We show that taking into account insights from socio-technical transition analysis
  can have large impacts on the projected transition strategy, especially regarding
  relatively costly technologies that currently have a high momentum. For instance,
  we find that the share of offshore wind in electricity generation in Europe is less
  than 3% or up to 27% by 2050, depending on the underlying narrative. These ranges
  are useful input for policy-makers, as they show the degree of flexibility in mitigation
  options. Furthermore, our analysis shows that combining IAMs with more detailed
  sectoral models illuminates the challenges on a more detailed geographical scale,
  for instance regarding storage requirements and the need for interconnectivity across
  European borders. Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc.
