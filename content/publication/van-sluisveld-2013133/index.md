abstract: The European Council Directive 94/62/EC for Packaging and Packaging Waste
  requires that Member States implement packaging waste prevention measures. However,
  consumption and subsequently packaging waste figures are still growing annually.
  It suggests that policies to accomplish packaging waste prevention do not suffice,
  especially since developments are less insightful as these are part of a self-declaring
  compliance system. This study is aimed at expanding the understanding of packaging
  source reduction. We collected and evaluated 131 available options implemented in
  the Netherlands in the period 2005-2010. Lightweighting has been identified as the
  most frequently applied packaging source reduction method, indicating that the packaging
  industry prioritizes low-effort and familiar concepts, despite the dichotomy in
  efficacy. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.
