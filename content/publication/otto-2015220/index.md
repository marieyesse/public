abstract: In recent years, an approach based on voluntary pledges by individual regions
  has attracted interest of policy-makers and consequently also climate policy research.
  In this paper, we analyze scenarios in which the EU and China act as early-movers
  in international climate policy. Such a situation risks leakage between regions
  with ambitious emission reduction targets and those with less ambitious targets
  via fossil-fuel markets, displacement of heavy industry and land-use consequences.
  We examine some of these factors using the IMAGE model. While IMAGE does not include
  all mechanisms, we find the leakage rate to be relatively small, about 5% of the
  emission reductions in the EU and China. The far majority occurs via the energy
  market channel and the remainder through land-use change. Reduced oil prices due
  to less depletion forms the key reason for this leakage impact. Â© 2014 Elsevier
