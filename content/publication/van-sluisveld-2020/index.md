abstract: In this study, we present and apply an interdisciplinary approach that systematically
  draws qualitative insights from socio-technical transition studies to develop new
  quantitative scenarios for integrated assessment modelling. We identify the transition
  narrative as an analytical bridge between socio-technical transition studies and
  integrated assessment modelling. Conceptual interaction is realised through the
  development of two contrasting transition narratives on the role of actors in meeting
  the European Unions' 80% greenhouse gas emission reduction objective for 2050. The
  first transition narrative outlines how large-scale innovation trajectories are
  driven by incumbent actors, whereas the second transition narrative assumes more
  ‘alternative’ strategies by new entrants with strong opposition to large-scale technologies.
  We use the multi-level perspective to draw out plausible storylines on actor positioning
  and momentum of change for several technological and social niche-innovations in
  both transition narratives. These storylines are then translated into quantitative
  scenarios for integrated assessment modelling. Although both developed transition
  pathways align with the European Union's low-carbon objective for 2050, we find
  that each pathway depicts a substantial departure from systems that are known to
  date. Future research could focus on further systematic (joint) development of operational
  links between the two analytical approaches, as well as work on improved representation
  of demand-oriented solutions in techno-economic modelling. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.
