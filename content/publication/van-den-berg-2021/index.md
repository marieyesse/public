abstract: Recent studies show that behaviour changes can provide an essential contribution
  to achieving the Paris climate targets. Existing climate change mitigation scenarios
  primarily focus on technological change and underrepresent the possible contribution
  of behaviour change. This paper presents and applies a methodology to decompose
  the factors contributing to changes in per capita emissions in scenarios. With this
  approach, we determine the relative contribution to total emissions from changes
  in activity, the way activities are carried out, the intensity of activities, as
  well as fuel choice. The decomposition tool breaks down per capita emissions loosely
  following the Kaya Identity, allowing a comparison between the contributions of
  technology and consumption changes among regions and between various scenarios.
  We illustrate the use of the tool by applying it to three previously-published scenarios;
  a baseline scenario, a scenario with a selection of behaviour changes, and a 2 °C
  scenario with the same selection of behaviour changes. Within these scenarios, we
  explore the contribution of technology and consumption changes to total emission
  changes in the transport and residential sector, for a selection of both developed
  and developing regions. In doing so, the tool helps identify where specifically
  (i.e. via consumption or technology factors) different measures play a role in mitigating
  emissions and expose opportunities for improved representation of behaviour changes
  in integrated assessment models. This research shows the value of the decomposition
  tool and how the approach could be flexibly replicated for different global models
  based on available variables and aims. The application of the tool to previously-published
  scenarios shows substantial differences in consumption and technology changes from
  CO2 price and behaviour changes, in transport and residential per capita emissions
  and between developing and developed regions. Furthermore, the tool’s application
  can highlight opportunities for future scenario development of a more nuanced and
  heterogeneous representation of behaviour and lifestyle changes in global models.
