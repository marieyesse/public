abstract: This paper systematically compares modeled rates of change provided by global
  integrated assessment models aiming for the 2. °C objective to historically observed
  rates of change. Such a comparison can provide insights into the difficulty of achieving
  such stringent climate stabilization scenarios. The analysis focuses specifically
  on the rates of change for technology expansion and diffusion, emissions and energy
  supply investments. The associated indicators vary in terms of system focus (technology-specific
  or energy system wide), temporal scale (timescale or lifetime), spatial scale (regional
  or global) and normalization (accounting for entire system growth or not). Although
  none of the indicators provide conclusive insights as to the achievability of scenarios,
  this study finds that indicators that look into absolute change remain within the
  range of historical growth frontiers for the next decade, but increase to unprecedented
  levels before mid-century. Indicators that take into account or normalize for overall
  system growth find future change to be broadly within historical ranges. This is
  particularly the case for monetary-based normalization metrics like GDP compared
  to energy-based normalization metrics like primary energy. By applying a diverse
  set of indicators alternative, complementary insights into how scenarios compare
  with historical observations are acquired but they do not provide further insights
  on the possibility of achieving rates of change that are beyond current day practice.
