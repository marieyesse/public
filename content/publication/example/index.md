abstract: "In this study we place the decarbonisation of four carbon and
  energy-intensive industries (respectively steel, cement, chemicals and pulp &
  paper) in the context of a global net-zero carbon emissions objective using
  the IMAGE integrated assessment model. We find that a global net-zero carbon
  emission ambition by 2050 implies the need for carbon offsets for most
  carbon-intensive industries and the sector as a whole. Particularly the steel
  and chemical sector depict strong inertias, for which the projections show
  net-zero pathways only under very specific narratives and likely outside of
  the 2050 timeline. Overall, the IMAGE model projects that the decarbonisation
  of carbon-intensive industries implies the electrification of iron & steel, a
  full dependency on carbon removal technologies in cement, the closing of
  carbon and material loops in the chemical sector and zero-carbon heating for
  the pulp & paper sector. However, given the limitations in representing
  industrial value chains and the missing or limited competition among the
  implemented decarbonisation strategies in IMAGE, we argue the outcomes to be
  biased towards producer focused, and often single-issue, solutions. The
  results therefore indicate a need for including a more diverse and tailored
  suite of industrial decarbonisation strategies and narratives in integrated
  assessment models than currently studied. "
