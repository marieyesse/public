abstract: 'In this deliverable a set of long-term strategies to decarbonise four industrial sectors – steel, plastics, paper and meat and dairy – has been assessed. Two modelling approaches have been applied to develop decarbonisation pathways for these manufacturing industries: the top-down integrated assessment model IMAGE and the bottom-up technology-rich model WISEE. Due to methodological differences,  two sets of scenarios have been developed and assessed in parallel. One set (IMAGE) is based on a cost-optimal reduction of greenhouse gases over time, regions, and sectors in line with the 2 °C and 1.5 °C climate objectives. The second set (WISEE) reflects on the speed of innovations, investment cycles (existing assets) and possible infrastructure limitations and includes a scenario strongly based on CCS and one on electrification and aspects of a circular economy. The projected pathways have been described in terms of change in production volume, total final energy consumption, and CO2 emissions to describe the contribution of the considered manufacturing industries and possible transformative pathways to complete the full decarbonisation of the EU economy by 2050.'

**Key take-away messages:**
- Total net decarbonisation by 2050 is considered feasible under specific future conditions for the four selected manufacturing sectors.

- Strategies on the full decarbonisation of industry require embedment into a broader systems view to remain aligned to the Paris Agreement

- The potential for emission reduction in the pulp and paper industry is huge, with bioenergy and CCS and electrification as important strategies

- In the plastics industry, closing of carbon cycles is a promising route for decarbonisation, next to improving efficiency and CCS

- Decarbonisation of the steel sector strongly depends on CCS and/or a switch from cokes to hydrogen as a reducing agent

- Biomass is projected to play an important role in the decarbonisation of the food processing sector, but alternatives have not yet been analysed in detail
