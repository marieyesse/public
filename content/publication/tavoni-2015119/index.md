abstract: Integrated assessment models can help in quantifying the implications of
  international climate agreements and regional climate action. This paper reviews
  scenario results from model intercomparison projects to explore different possible
  outcomes of post-2020 climate negotiations, recently announced pledges and their
  relation to the 2 °C target. We provide key information for all the major economies,
  such as the year of emission peaking, regional carbon budgets and emissions allowances.
  We highlight the distributional consequences of climate policies, and discuss the
  role of carbon markets for financing clean energy investments, and achieving efficiency
  and equity. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.
