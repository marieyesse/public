abstract: Recent studies show that lifestyle changes can provide an essential contribution
  to achieving the Paris climate targets. While some efforts have been made to incorporate
  lifestyle changes into model-based scenarios, the attempts are currently very stylised
  and included exogenously. This paper discusses current efforts to represent lifestyle
  change in models, and analyses potential insights from relevant scientific disciplines
  to improve the representation of lifestyle changes in models – including modelling
  specific behaviour changes, identifying cross-cutting lifestyle solutions, representing
  the intentions behind the changes and quantifying their impacts. As such, this research
  attempts to bridge the gap between qualitative and quantitative theories and methodologies.
  Based on the results of this literature analysis, we recommend defining lifestyle
  changes more harmoniously, exploring an expanded range of approaches, domains and
  transformative solutions, adopting a whole-systems approach, and addressing the
  trade-offs between the use of exogenous inputs and endogenous modelling. © 2019
